# botcscripts

A collection of Blood on the Clocktower scripts, rendered by [scriptmaker](https://github.com/rsarvar1a/scriptmaker) into PDFs and then split into PNG files for other uses.

Each `script.json` is packaged next to its PDFs, so feel free to use this as a storytelling resource! 
- *some homebrew scripts only contain `id`s because `scriptmaker` knows how to read them...* 
- *but the official apps won't.*
