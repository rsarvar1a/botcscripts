# Characters

## Townsfolk

### Heartthrob
- absolutely essential role since there are some trace-critical Townsfolk
- also is swap-proof itself
  - each night, provided the holder is not evil, the heartthrob will ping once
  - gaps in the trace indicate evil was holding the role

### Romantic
- I love this role, as it is a Townsfolk "confirmer"
- knowing certain roles (or bluffs) are in your neighbourhood gives Town hope to trace swaps

### Bachelor
- this is deceptively powerful (if traced) as it is an outright bluff filter in larger games

### Drama Queen
- "thought you were evil" should read "were mad that you are evil" for Base3 consistency
- otherwise, determining "thought" is arbitrarily hard as ST

### Delinquent
- I would enjoy this idea if there were more incentives to publicly claim roles

### Caretaker
- very interesting tracer, and with luck you can narrow down the role location
- how does the ST respond to players during the day that believe they might be Caretaker?
  - if arbitrary yes/no answer, it's ok
  - otherwise, all non-Caretakers are confirmed, so might as well make it know itself

### Goth
- imo this is weak, because many Demons are causing swaps on their kills
- so those swaps are hard to trace, as one end stops receiving info on death

### Loner
- very interesting way to run a protection mechanic
- that being said, it's absurdly fragile since it can just disappear on choice
- protection is already not that strong so I think it's too crippling

### Pickpocket
- I suppose that this is meant to hit Minions and turn them into Town benefits
- base ability is absurdly powerful
  - if you hit Director or Playwright, you are playing to swap the Demon onto a Townsfolk
  - if a chosen good selects a player and that player dies, it's an execution target
  - evil has lost all game agency with one swap

### Stargirl
- this should probably be unswappable
    - frequent swaps means you have absolutely no data with which to guess
    - also, how are you supposed to know when you can guess (Caretaker problem)

### Method Actor
- absolutely hilarious interplay with the Jester if you so choose

### Spectator
- a beacon of sanity, no notes

### Relict
- there is a lot of misregistration on this script, but it still finds concentrated evil
- still good to bust swap chains that don't actually exist

## Outsiders

### Dropout
-
