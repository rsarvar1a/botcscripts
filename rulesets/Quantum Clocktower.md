# The Laws of Quantum Mechanics

1. All players always exist in a superposition of all characters and states in which they could possibly be.

2. Players tell the Storyteller their choices and information each night, which become true unless mechanically impossible. Players learn when they make an impossible choice, and must change that choice. If mutually exclusive events would occur simultaneously, one occurs at random.

3. Players receive specific prompts if and only if their superposition has collapsed to only contain states where they receive that specific prompt.

4. Players appear to die if and only if their superposition has collapsed to only contain states where they have died. If a playerâ€™s superposition collapses in such manner during the day, the player appears to die after that day's execution.

5. Players can nominate and vote without consuming their vote token if and only if they appear alive.

6. The game proceeds in strict night order, but if a player's choice is impossible, they make a new choice for the entire night (ideally submitting multiple possibilities at once, processed in order submitted), so they may submit a choice that will happen before their first attempt would have happened in the night.

7. Starting alignment will be rolled randomly. After that, starting evils (if any) will learn each other and then submit who they learn as demon/minions within that team when they submit N1 actions. Evil starting information happens simultaneously, at the very start of N1.

8. All game rules are always followed, and the setup is always valid.

9. The game continues if possible, ending if and only if its superposition has collapsed to only contain states where it ends.

10. When the game ends, good wins ties within a possible game state (per normal BotC rules; example is executing the demon at final 3). Evil wins ties between possible game states (unique Quantum rule; example is executing the superpositioned Lleech/Pukka at final 3).
